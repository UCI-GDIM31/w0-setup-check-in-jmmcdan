# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.

My name is Juliana and I use she/her pronouns. I like to play a lot of different games, but some of my favorites are Resident Evil 4 remake, Hades, Battle Chef Brigade, and Horizon Zero Dawn. I'm taking this class as it is needed for my major, but also because I want to start learning how to make games. I don't have a lot of prior experience other than very simple games with text and numbers in my high school computer science class. Not really sure what kinds of games I want to make in the future, but maybe roguelikes or story games.

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [x] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?

I am hoping to get a basic understanding of how to make games and meet some other people within my major.

4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?

I'm a little nervous for group work because I really don't know anyone in the class, but I do feel like that will be only a problem at the start.

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)

I have taken a computer science class where I learned how to code in Java and I know a very small amount of python.

2. Game development (any engine)

I've followed a tutorial on how to set-up a game environment in Unreal Engine, but that's pretty much all my experience other than basic text games.

3. Unity

0

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document

3. Iteration

This is when an action or set of actions is repeated multiple times.
